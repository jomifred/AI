<h1>Badge problem</h1>
<i>Author: Hakan Kjellerstrand,

<br><br>
One of the best collections of machine learning data sets 
(<a href="ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/">ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/</a>) 
includes this "recreational" data set called "Badge Problem". I havn't seen 
any solutions to the problem anywhere, so here is my take. 
<br>
(The full URL to the badge files is 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/badges">ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/badges</a>.)

<br><br>
In this problem I used the open source machine learning/data mining tool Weka,
(written in Java). Go to 
<a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/%7Eml/weka/">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/</a> 
to read more. Also read about the very inspiring book "Data Mining: Practical 
Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations" (written by
Ian H. Witten and Eibe Frank) which describes machine learning and the Weka 
tool: <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/%7Eml/weka/book.html">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/book.html</a>.


<h2>Presentation of the problem</h2>
There was not much information about the problem (which makes it fun!). 
From the informations file <a href="http://www.hakank.org/data_mining/badges.info">badges.info</a>:
<pre>1. Title: ML94/COLT94 Badge Problem

2. Source Information
   -- Creator: Haym Hirsh, after an idea by Rob Schapire
   -- Donor: Haym Hirsh (hirsh@cs.rutgers.edu)
   -- Date: September, 1994
 
3. Past Usage:
    Every pre-registered attendee at the 1994 Machine Learning
    Conference and 1994 Computational Learning Theory Conference received
    a badge labeled with a "+" or "-".  The labeling was due to some
    function known only to the badge generator (Haym Hirsh), and it
    depended only on the attendee's name.  The goal for conference
    attendees was to identify the unknown function used to generate the
    +/- labeling.

4. Relevant Information:
    Part of the problem in using an automated program to discover the
    unknown target function is to decide how to encode names such that
    the program can be used.  The data below are presented in the form
    of a +/- label followed by the person's name.  It is up to the
    learning-system user to decide how to convert this data into something
    usable by the system (e.g., what attributes to use if your favorite
    learner requires feature-vector data).
</pre>

The problem data:
<ul>
 <li>as plain text: <a href="http://www.hakank.org/data_mining/badges.data">badges.data</a>
 </li><li>as ARFF file <a href="http://www.hakank.org/data_mining/badges_plain.arff">badges_plain.arff</a> (the
file format often used in Weka)
</li></ul>

<br><br>
<font color="green" size="+1">
<b>Now, please take some minutes and try it yourself!</b>
</font>
<br><br>

<h2>My solution</h2>
The first thing to realize is that just the data in the original file 
will not get us any long way in our <b>machine learning</b> project. 
It must be completed with other attributes such as different lengths, counts 
etc. But what lengths or counts? Of course, we could sit down for a time and 
try to solve it in our head (it is very well possible), but my personal object
was to use machine learning tools. 
<br><br>
Note: I assumed that the solution was to be found by treating the names as 
string, i.e. it could not be a very far fetched solution such as information 
not given in the data set, such as the person's length, age or time they 
talked at the conference.
<br><br>

It took some minutes to think of and generates a couple of possible solutions.
As you may notice by the number of attributes I tried, I didn't get the
solution directly.
<br><br>

The attributes I tried was:
<br><br>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>Attribute name, and type</b></td>
<td><b>Explanation</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
name {...}
</td>
<td>
all the names (given in the original)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
length numeric
</td>
<td>
length of name
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>
even_odd {0,1}
</td>
<td>
length of name even or odd?
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
first_char_vowel {0,1} 
</td>
<td>
is first character a vowel?
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
second_char_vowel {0,1}  
</td>
<td>
is second character a vowel?
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
vowels numeric 
</td>
<td>
number of vowels in the name
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
consonants numeric
</td>
<td>
number of consonants
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
vowel_consonant_ratio numeric
</td>
<td>
the ratio of vowels / consonant (this is not farfetched???)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
spaces numeric
</td>
<td>
number of spaces
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
dots numeric 
</td>
<td>
number of "." in the name, i.e. name initials
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
words numeric
</td>
<td>
number of words, i.e number of names, including name initials..
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
class {+,-}
</td>
<td>
the badge labels (given in the original)
</td>
</tr>

I used this Perl program to generate the ARFF data file. Perl is <b>very</b>
handy for this kind of stuff!

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# 
# Sun Oct 14 08:55:57 2001/hakank@bonetmail.com
# 
# Generate attributes for the badges problem
# 
$|=1;
use strict;

my $file = "badges.data";

open FILE, $file or die "Cannot open $file: $!";

my %data = ();
while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
  next if /^\s*$/;
  chomp;
  $data{$2} = $1 if m/([+-])\s+(.+)$/;
}

my @names = join ",", map {"\"$_\""} sort keys %data;

print&lt;&lt;EOF;
\@relation badges
\@attribute name {@names}
\@attribute length numeric
\@attribute even_odd {0,1}
\@attribute first_char_vowel {0,1}
\@attribute second_char_vowel {0,1}
\@attribute vowels numeric
\@attribute consonants numeric
\@attribute vowel_consonant_ratio numeric
\@attribute spaces numeric
\@attribute dots numeric
\@attribute words numeric
\@attribute class {-,+}
\@data
EOF

foreach my $name (sort keys %data) {
  my @name              = split //, $name;

  my $length            = length $name;
  my $even_odd_len      = ($length % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 0;
  my ($vowels, $consonants, $spaces, $ratio, $dots)
                        = vowels_consonants_spaces($name);
  my $first_char_vowel  = (is_vowel($name[0]) == 1) ? 1 : 0;
  my $second_char_vowel = (is_vowel($name[1]) == 1) ? 1 : 0;
  my @words             = split /\s+/, $name;
  my $words             = scalar @words;

  print "\"$name\", $length, $even_odd_len, $first_char_vowel, $second_char_vowel, $vowels, $consonants, $ratio, $spaces, $dots, $words, $data{$name}\n";
}


sub is_vowel {
  my ($char) = @_;

  return 1 if lc $char =~ /^[aeiou]$/i;

  return 0;
}


sub vowels_consonants_spaces {
  my ($name)     = @_;

  my $vowels     = 0;
  my $consonants = 0;
  my $spaces     = 0;
  my $dots       = 0;

  for (split //, $name) {
    $_ = lc $_;
    if (/[aeiou]/i)     {
      $vowels++;
    } elsif ($_ eq " ") {
      $spaces++;
    } elsif ($_ eq ".") {
      $dots++;
    } else              {
      $consonants++
    }

  }

  my $ratio = sprintf "%0.2f", $vowels/$consonants;
  return ($vowels, $consonants, $spaces, $ratio, $dots);

}
</pre>

For all the different trials I made (i.e. versions of the Perl program), I 
then tested the generated ARFF file (mainly) with Weka's J48 decision tree 
algorithm, to see if there was some sort of indication of patterns or
regularities. 
<br>
(The reason I used J48 was that it's one of my favorite in Weka since it's 
very fast and it give a good overview of the solution, as a decision tree. 
Luckily the "badge function" was of the right kind.)
<br><br>

And then the following Weka command [I used the command line commands of Weka;
there is also a very nice GUI]:
<br><br>
<pre>java weka.classifiers.trees.j48.J48 -t badges2.arff
</pre>
<br>
produced the this (somewhat stripped) result:
<br>
<pre>J48 pruned tree
---------------

second_char_vowel = 0: - (84.0)
second_char_vowel = 1: + (210.0)

....
=== Error on training data ===

Correctly Classified Instances         294              100      %
.....

=== Confusion Matrix ===

   a   b   &lt;-- classified as
  84   0 |   a = -
   0 210 |   b = +
....
</pre>

Ah, so the labels "+" and "-" corresponds exactly with the occurence of a 
vowel in the second position in the name! 

<br><br>
Here is the final generated ARFF file <a href="http://www.hakank.org/data_mining/badges2.arff">badges2.arff</a>.


<h3>Final note</h3>
This was a fun little problem! And I actually learn a thing or two by
twiddling with it.
<br><br>
How long did the complete task took? I didn't clock the time exactly, but it
probably took about the same time as it did for me to write (and re-edit) this HTML report, somewhere between 30-45 minutes.
<br><br>
I did get astray in my pursuit for a while since I temporarily forgot that in 
english the letter "Y" is not a vowel (which it is in swedish, my native 
language). And once I remember that, it was then an easy way forward.
